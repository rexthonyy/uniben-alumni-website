					The University of Benin Alumni Association came into existence in 1969, four (4) years after the first 41 graduates were turned out of the University that was established in 1962.

					The idea of the Alumni Association was conceived when it was considered necessary to create an organization that would embrace different generations of the University. The body was expected to play a dominant role in the life of the University by reflecting the views of its graduates.

				The Alumni Association was formally launched on the 16th January, 1970 by the Pro-Chancellor, late Justice J. I. C. Taylor with the late Justice J. S. Mariere, then Chancellor of the University as the Chairman of the occasion. At that epoch making event, Mr. Kayode Anjorin, a 1966 graduate of Business Administration assumed office as the first National President of the Association.</p>

				<p class="rex-line-height-normal rex-fs-normal">To enhance the smooth administration of the Association, the University established the Alumni Relations Unit in the office of the Vice Chancellor with an alumnus as the administrative officer whose mandate was to establish and maintain an enduring link between the University and its graduates, compiling an Alumni list and publishing a newsletter. In recent years, the University has merged the Alumni Relations Unit with the Endowment Unit forming the Office of Advancement under the global dispensation of developmental activities.

					Over the years, a lot of positive developments have been recorded in the management and administration of the Association which has since taken over the publication of the magazine “UNILAG ALUMNI” and the newsletter “THE GRADUATE”. The Association has also secured a permanent seat on the University’s Governing Council.
