					The University of Benin Alumni Association, Asaba Branch was founded in 1997 as a 2-man Association by Mr. Israel Odibeli and Engr. Solomon S. Onogure. Both of them were resident in Ibusa near Asaba and met in the evenings to strategise on how to get members to join the Association especially in Asaba which is a major hub of residents of graduates from the University.
					After a list of known members had been drawn up, they embarked on membership. A major breakthrough came when Chief (Pharm.) Dennis Amafor, who gave full support to the move.
					Mr. Victor Ochunor, then Secretary of the Delta State Branch of the Nigerian Union of Teachers, himself an Alumnus, offered the use of their Conference room for the monthly meetings. Refreshments then were sometimes provided for members in the form of biscuits and mineral drinks. Attendance at meetings were poor as persons seen in one meeting were absent at the next. There were times when only Mr. Israel Odibeli and Engr. Solomon S. Onogure would be present at a monthly meeting.
					Following the movement of the NUT from their rented office building opposite St. Patricks College, to their permanent site in 1998, a benevolent Alumnus who was a Vice Principal at the school offered the use of a classroom for the monthly meetings. At this time, hosting of meetings by individuals was out of the plan as they felt that members who were not financially sound would shy away from meetings. Members later volunteered to host in the central meeting place.
				Initial Executive members were:</p>

					<li>
						Engr. Solomon Onogure - Chairman

					Later, Chief Amafor offered the use of a large hall at the top of his Pharmacy, Helt Hospitale near the Fedral Medical Centre. This better venue for meeting saw a growth of membership in the Association.  Membership however, surged with the coming of the civilian administration in 1999 which witnessed the influx of many graduates of the University both as key officials in Government and new recruits in the Civil Service and Public Service.
					Sequel to this monumental increase in membership, there was then the need for a lager venue for meetings. Thus, meetings were shifted to Nelrose Hotel. With the recurrent issue of poor finance, meetings were then hosted by members on rotational basis with their choice of venue. This is the position till date.
					Like an acorn, the University of Benin Alumni Association, Asaba Branch, has grown into an oak. The Branch has over these years have blossomed with some achievements including:
					Regular and well attended monthly meetings on rotational basis, hosted by members on every second Wednesday of the month at 4pm.
					Regular and well attended Exco meetings on rotational basis, hosted by Exco members.
					Meet our members social demands and entitlements in respect of social outings in which we were invited. 
					Have a workable Bye-Law that guides activities and conduct of members.
					The Branch over the years, carries out academic programmes to impact her immediate environment. It started initially as 'Schools Challenge' now 'Schools Reward for Excellence' targeted at Secondary Schools in Asaba and environs. 
					The Branch has hosted the NEC of the global body.

					Some members of the branch have served while some others are still serving on the national body at executive level.

					In order to meet the yearnings and aspiration of the association, the Delta State govt donated a parcel of land to the body located at Mariam Babangida Road by Board of Internal revenue.
					Construction work has commenced in the site and the structure is at decking level. The structure, upon completion, apart from becoming the Secretariat and meeting venue, it contains two multipurpose halls that will attract income to the association.
